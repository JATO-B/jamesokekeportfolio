                        <p>James Okeke is a calm and dedicated cybersecurity learner currently building a solid foundation in 
                        Offensive security, defensive operations, and strategic governance. His interest in cybersecurity grew 
                        from a lifelong desire to protect people, a value shaped by his years of service as a teacher, mentor, 
                        and Vice Principal.</p>

                        <p>His background in education strengthened his communication, leadership, and analytical abilities, 
                        while managing digital exam systems for over 600 students developed his attention to detail and problem-solving
                        mindset. These qualities now influence his approach to cybersecurity: careful, structured, and user-centered.</p>

                        <p>James has hands-on experience with vulnerability assessments, Android forensics, virtual labs, and 
                        security tools such as Nmap, pfSense, and Autopsy. He continues to expand his technical capabilities through
                     certifications, practical projects, and continuous learning.</p>

                        <p>He is currently developing broad cybersecurity competencies while preparing to specialize in defensive security 
                        and eventually cloud security. With a strong commitment to growth and a people-first mindset, James aims to 
                        contribute to safer digital environments and support organizations in strengthening their security posture.</p>
